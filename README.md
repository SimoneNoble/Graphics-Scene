# Graphics-Scene

A graphical scene written in C++ that utilises OpenGL and has mesh models imported from TurboSquid. Implements an ambient moving light source, water which reflects the cube map, and an animated character. A camera automatically moves through key features of the scene. In progress with adding more advanced features such as shadow mapping, post processing and deferred rendering.
