# Graphics-Scene

A graphical scene written in C++ that utilises OpenGL and has mesh models imported from TurboSquid. Implements an ambient moving light source, water which reflects the cube map, and an animated character. A camera automatically moves through key features of the scene. In progress with adding more advanced features such as shadow mapping, post processing and deferred rendering.

Press 3 to escape from automatic camera panning, then WASD keys to move manually throughout the scene. The SHIFT and SPACE keys are to move up and down respectively, and pitch and yaw are determined by the mouse's relative position.
